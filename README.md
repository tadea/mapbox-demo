# MapBox Demo App

## About
This project was part of a 4-hour hackathon. We were given instructions to use our imagination with Mapbox. 
This app will give you some fun facts about the cities in Croatia. They are already pinned into the map. After you click on pins it will show up a pop-up with a fun fact and link to learn more about it. 

Mapbox GL JS is a JavaScript library that uses WebGL to render interactive maps from vector tiles and Mapbox styles.
The Mapbox Maps SDKs are open-source libraries for embedding highly customized maps in web and mobile applications.
